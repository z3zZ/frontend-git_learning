        I don't know how it ends, I can't see it in the distance
        But can you ever reach the end of a timeless existence?


        I'll bet ya I can run faster with no wind resistance
        I'll fly under no conditions
        Teach myself complete submission
        While I grant myself complete permission


        Just imagine being human
        Hating your confusion
        Denying 'til it's proven
        Laughing at illusion
        Thinking institution's the solution
        While tyranny and irony float in its pollution
        Imagine reducing yourself to your name
        Janet, you've got no one else you can blame
        You've suck all your consciousness inside of your brain
        So now you just shoot stuff inside of your veins
        So go ahead and find your meaning
        With your methamphetamine
        And once you can see that you've trapped all your grace
        Maybe you'll join me and girl we can race


        I'll bet ya I can run faster with no wind resistance
        I'll fly under no conditions
        Teach myself complete submission
        While I grant myself complete permission


        No streets, receipts
        Off-beat heartbeats
        Just window seats
        For free, for free

        I've been here sixty years and I'm still not bored
        There's absolutely nothing that I can't afford
        And I've found that almost everything is made of cardboard
        And there's absolutely nothing I can't sing with weird chords and


        I can run faster with no wind resistance
        I'll fly under no conditions
        Teach myself complete submission
        While I grant myself complete permission
